## Roadmap of Future Improvements
1 Update each square's background to 'green', considering the winner's combination

Inside the JSX file, within the checkForWinner function, I would introduce a for loop or a map to update the winning squares' background. Probably first I would include a new CSS class called 'winner block' for styling outside of the JSX.

2 Update the symbols being used. Rather than just text, I would upload an SVG of an 'X' and a 'O' considering a different design.

In the CSS file, I would replace the "red" and "white" classes for using the previous SVGs in the folder.
