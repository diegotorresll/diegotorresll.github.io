Project Title
# üè¶ Tiered Bad Bank

## Description/Motivation:
This project serves as a demonstration of a full-stack application, utilizing the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) as part of my capstone project for the MIT coding bootcamp. It effectively showcases the React architecture within a three-tier application framework, encompassing a browser-based client, an HTTP server, and a data storage layer. Additionally, the project incorporates essential features of authentication and authorization.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

1 You have installed the latest version of Node.js and npm
2 You have a Git client installed
3 You have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository, run the following command in your terminal:

``
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
``
Navigate to the project directory:

``
cd your-project-name
``

### Installing Dependencies
Install the necessary packages using npm:

``
npm install
``

This command reads the package.json file and installs all the dependencies required for the project.

### Configuration
If your project requires any environment variables or specific configuration, provide instructions here. For example:

Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following:

``
API_KEY=your_api_key
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASS=password
``
### Running the Application
To run the application on your local server, execute:

``
npm start
``
This will start the server (typically on localhost:3000, but this may vary depending on your project settings).

## Running Tests
